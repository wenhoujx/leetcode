# Study scala syntax with Leetcode

Scala is quite rich in functional style functions and syntax. I want to study it by solving leetcode problems.

`scala.sc` contains scala solution to leetcode problems.

To run the scala code, you need to install [scala](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/scala) and [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) first.

```sh
scala-cli scala.sc
```
